# EDA_BYMA_Volume_Market

The goal of this study is to explore BYMA´s volume in one year. We´ll get some ideas of what happened throught the year and which stock were the most prominents.
We do not stop to study each particular stock, in this case we preceed to view BYMA´s volume globally, preparing to begin exploring a particular stock or group of stocks.

# Insights summary 


The most important findings from this exploration involve the volume correlation between two groups of stocks: “Leading Panel” and “General Panels,” where the most prominent stocks
are in the leading panel.


♦ Firstly we can find that the total volume per day of both panels has a correlation of 0.36 throughout the year

Correlation of the volume of each stock in the general panel with the total volume of the leading panel:

♦ An important period occurring between 2024-01-18 and 2024-02-05 is when the overall panel volume increases above that of the leading panel:

 ♦ Two stocks could have the same volume but their price could go in oposit directions and this could be a clue of capital flow from one group of stocks to another, but this was not the case.


 We can see the price change correlation at 2024-01-18 to 2024-02-05:
